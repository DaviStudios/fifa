        Step back in time with "FIFA87," a nostalgic blast from the past! This 2D football game takes you on a journey to the golden era of gaming, offering a charmingly retro experience that will delight both football enthusiasts and fans of classic gaming.

Set in the year 1987, you'll have the chance to lace up your virtual boots and take control of three iconic characters hailing from the Czech Republic. Your mission? To face off against the formidable Italian team in an epic showdown on the pixelated pitch. Each player from the Czech Republic boasts unique skills and abilities, making every match a thrilling and distinct experience.

But here's the twist: "FIFA87" allows you to bend the rules a bit. Feel like giving your opponents a run for their money with some cheeky tricks? Go for it! Want to bend the rules and unleash your creativity on the field? The game encourages it! However, there's one crucial caveat: if you decide to cheat and then share your exploits on the internet, you'll face the ultimate penalty - a ban from the "FIFA87" community. So, while mischief on the pitch is allowed, remember to keep it offline!
